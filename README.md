## ETERNAL JAVASCRIPT

This repository is a place where i can think about, test and write JavaScript code on a daily basis outside of my work responsibilities 
(...where I think about, test and write code too!). 

It's in a fledgling state, but it grows I hope this repository can be a companion to others on their programming journey.
