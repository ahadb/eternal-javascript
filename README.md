## ETERNAL JAVASCRIPT

This repository is a place where I can think about, test and write vanilla JavaScript code on a daily basis outside of my work responsibilities 
(...where I think about, test and write code too!). 

It's in a fledgling state without order as-of-now, but will be more organized as it grows - I hope that it will accompany others on their JavaScript 
journey and thirst for knowledge.
