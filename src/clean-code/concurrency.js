 * =====
 * Concurrency: JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it runs one task at a time. 
 * - these threads are event-based and only triggered by the occurrence of events.
 * - JavaScript's concurrency model is based on an event loop, which executes the code and processes events. 
 * - JavaScript handles concurrency by default with an asynchronous programming model using event loops, callbacks, promises, or async/await.
